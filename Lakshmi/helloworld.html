Faculty members are required to report all infractions to the office of Student Conduct and </strong><strong>Ethical Development. The website for Student Conduct and Ethical Development is available at </strong><a href="http://www.sa.sjsu.edu/judicial_affairs/index.html"><strong>http://www.sa.sjsu.edu/judicial_affairs/index.html</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p><p><strong>Instances of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Cheating on exams or plagiarism (presenting the work of another as your own, or the use of another person’s ideas without giving proper credit) will result in a failing grade and sanctions by the University. For this class, all assignments are to be completed by the individual student unless otherwise specified. If you would like to include in your assignment any material you have submitted, or plan to submit for another class, please note that SJSU’s Academic Policy F06-1 requires approval of instructors.</strong></p><h3>Campus Policy in Compliance with the American Disabilities Act</h3><p><strong>If you need course adaptations or accommodations because of a disability, or if you need to make special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please make an appointment with me as soon as possible, or see me during office hours. Presidential Directive 97-03 requires that students with disabilities requesting accommodations must register with the DRC (Disability Resource Center) to establish a record of their disability.</strong></p><h3>Course Policy on Plagiarism</h3><ul><li><strong>Copying online content without correct quote is treated as plagiarism in this class.</strong></li><li><strong>Both the person who copies and the person who facilitates the copying will be prosecuted for academic dishonesty.</strong></li><li><strong>A student or students involved in a cheating incident involving any non-exam instrument (homework, reports, projects, or class exercises) will receive an F on that instrument, and will be reported to the judicial affairs office. Whether the report will carry a recommendation for disciplinary action will be left to my judgment.</strong></li><li><strong>A student or students involved in a cheating incident on any quick test, the midterm exam or the final exam will receive an F in the course, and will be reported to the judicial affairs office with a recommendation for disciplinary action.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Things (among many others) you may not do when working with other students (except for team work):</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The term “solution” mentioned below means anything (code, design document, description, etc.) you will submit for assignments and exams.</strong></li><li><strong>Work on an assignment together, type in solutions (separately or together) and turn in separate copies.</strong></li><li><strong>Each works on a part of an assignment and turn in separate copies after combining solutions.</strong></li><li><strong>Give any part of your solution (through paper, board writing, email, web </strong><strong>posting, reading loud, letting someone else look at your screen, etc.) to other students before the assignment deadline.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Things you may do when working with other students:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Discuss with other students and leave the discussion with empty hands.</strong></li><li><strong>Share assignment solutions after the assignment deadline in order to compare different techniques used for solving the problems.</strong></li></ul><h2>Learning Assistance Resource Center </h2><p><strong>The Learning Assistance Resource Center (LARC) is located in Room 600 in the Student Services Center.
